# Project in EMLI
The GitHub has been divided into two sections. The code on the raspberry pi (the camera) is under the "camera" folder. The code on the drone is under the "drone" folder. The metadata the drone uploads get uploaded under the "drone" folder in a folder called "photos" under the folders with the name of the date of when the pictures the metadata is describing was taken.

This project was developed by Isabella, Nikolas, and Rokas from group 07.
