    "Text": " The image shows a view from above of an interior ceiling. The ceiling appears to have a patterned design, with what seems to be white tiles or panels arranged in a grid or rectangular layout. There are also what look like small circular elements on the surface of the ceiling. On the right side of the photo, there is a brown cardboard box that is slightly tilted and resting against a wall. The image itself has a grainy quality and is taken at an angle where some parts of the ceiling are not fully visible. There is no text or other distinguishable features in the photo to provide more context. "
