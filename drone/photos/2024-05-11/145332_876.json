    "Text": " This is a photograph of the interior of a building. The ceiling appears to be tiled with a lighter color, possibly white or gray. There are three circular lights affixed to the ceiling at different points: one closer to the center of the image and two further away, aligned horizontally from left to right. The wall adjacent to the ceiling is also tiled but in a darker shade, providing a contrast with the lighter tiles on the ceiling. The photo has a neutral tone and is taken from an angle that captures part of the ceiling and a portion of the wall. "
