    "Text": " The image shows an interior ceiling view of a building. There are several round light fixtures recessed into the ceiling, which appears to be made of metal panels. The lighting creates a pattern on the ceiling. In the bottom right corner of the image, there is a small text overlay that seems to be part of a larger image or document, but it's not entirely clear from this cropped section. "
