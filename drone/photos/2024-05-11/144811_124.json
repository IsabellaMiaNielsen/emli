    "Text": " The image shows an interior view of a ceiling with acoustic tiles. There are three visible circular objects, which could be fire sprinklers or light fixtures, mounted on the tiles. The ceiling has a grid-like pattern, and there is a dark area in the upper left corner that might suggest a missing tile or another type of ceiling feature. The image appears to have been taken from a lower angle looking up towards the ceiling. There are no visible texts, brand logos, or other distinguishing features in this part of the image. "
