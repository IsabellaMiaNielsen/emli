    "Text": " The image shows an interior view of a ceiling with a grid-like pattern. There are circular elements that appear to be lights or fixtures, and one of them is illuminated. The ceiling is gray, and the photo seems to have been taken from a ground-level perspective looking up towards the ceiling. Below the ceiling, there's a partial view of what might be the floor of a public building, such as an airport terminal or a large indoor space. The lighting suggests it could be daytime. There is no visible text in the image to provide additional context about the location or purpose of this space. "
