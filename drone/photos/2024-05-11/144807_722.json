    "Text": " The image shows a view from above, looking down at what appears to be the underside of a ceiling. The ceiling is tiled with grey tiles and has several circular light fixtures. These lights are mounted on the ceiling's structure, which seems to be made of a metal framework. There are no visible people or objects in this perspective. The image is slightly blurred, suggesting it might have been taken from a moving vehicle or with an unsteady camera. "
