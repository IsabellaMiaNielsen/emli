    "Text": " The image shows an interior view of a ceiling, possibly from an architectural or engineering perspective. It features a series of structural ribs forming a pattern that covers the entire ceiling surface. Two circular objects are embedded in the ceiling at different points: one near the center and the other towards the top right corner. The ceiling appears to be a composite material with a textured finish, which could suggest it's designed for sound absorption or insulation. The lighting in the room casts shadows on the ceiling, indicating a light source located above the field of view. "
