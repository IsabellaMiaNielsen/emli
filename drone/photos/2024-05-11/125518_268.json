    "Text": " The image shows an interior view of a building, specifically focusing on the underside of a ceiling. This area has a patterned with hexagonal tiles that appear to be made from corrugated metal or a similar material. In the center of the photo is a circular light fixture, and two small, round lights are mounted at different heights along the right edge. The walls of the space are not visible; instead, we see the underside of what seems to be a canopy or ceiling structure. There is no text or additional objects that provide context or information about the location or purpose of this space. "
