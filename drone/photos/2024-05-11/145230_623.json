    "Text": " This image shows an interior view of a ceiling with acoustic tiles, which are commonly used in commercial buildings to reduce noise levels. There are circular light fixtures visible on the tiles. The pattern of the tiles suggests a design that could be used to improve sound insulation or aesthetics within a space. The room appears to be empty and is taken from a perspective below the ceiling, looking upwards. "
