    "Text": " The image shows an interior view, specifically a ceiling with acoustic panels. There's a person standing in the foreground of the photo; they are taking a selfie and appear to be indoors, possibly in a public building or event space given the presence of circular lighting fixtures on the ceiling. The ceiling is white and features a patterned design, likely for sound dampening purposes. There's a watermark across the image with text that seems to be a placeholder or a logo, but it's not clear enough to read. "
