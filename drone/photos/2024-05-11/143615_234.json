    "Text": " The image shows a ceiling view of what appears to be a room with a drop ceiling. There are three circular light fixtures on the ceiling, each located at an intersection of what might be rows or aisles. The drop tiles of the ceiling have a corrugated pattern and appear to be made of metal. There is no visible text or branding in this image. The lighting in the room is diffused, suggesting multiple light sources are contributing to the illumination. The overall tone of the image is neutral with muted colors. "
