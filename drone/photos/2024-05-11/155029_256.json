    "Text": " The image shows an interior view of a ceiling with a series of light fixtures and round ventilation units. There is also a patterned tile design visible on the ceiling. Below the ceiling, we can see a portion of what appears to be a floor or platform, but it's not fully visible in this angle. The image has an overexposed quality, with areas of the photo being very bright, which could indicate a glare or a setting where the lighting is high. There are no texts or distinctive features that provide context for the location or purpose of the ceiling. "
