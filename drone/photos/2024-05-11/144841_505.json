    "Text": " The image shows an interior space with a ceiling that appears to be made of corrugated metal panels. There are three circular objects visible on the ceiling: one is closer and looks like a fire sprinkler, another is further away and seems to be a light fixture, and the third, at the far end of the room, could possibly be a speaker or another type of ceiling-mounted device. The room has a neutral color palette with shades of gray and beige. There is no text visible in the image. "
