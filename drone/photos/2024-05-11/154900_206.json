    "Text": " In the image, there's a person standing in front of a ceiling with white tiles and some circular elements. The individual appears to be holding a phone close to their face, which suggests they might be engaged in a video call or taking a selfie. They are wearing a red cap, which is visible against the neutral background. The image has an overlay with a pattern that resembles a wall, and there's a watermark on the right side of the image, but it's not clear what the watermark says. The overall scene seems to be taken from a public space like a waiting room or a lobby, as indicated by the design of the ceiling and the presence of the person using their phone. "
