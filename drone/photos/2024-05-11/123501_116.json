    "Text": " The image shows an interior ceiling with several circular recessed lights. These lights appear to be flush-mounted, providing a modern and unobtrusive look. The ceiling itself is tiled, suggesting that the space might be a public building such as a shopping mall or a museum. There are no visible people or items in this section of the image. The lighting pattern is uniform across the tiles, indicating a well-planned design for illumination. "
