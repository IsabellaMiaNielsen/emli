    "Text": " The image shows the interior view of a ceiling. It features a patterned with white tiles, creating a grid-like appearance. There are multiple circular lights embedded in the ceiling at different intervals, providing illumination. Additionally, there is a ventilation grille near the center of the ceiling, suggesting that this area might be part of an air conditioning or heating system.
