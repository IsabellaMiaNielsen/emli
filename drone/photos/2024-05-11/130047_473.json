    "Text": " The image shows the underside of a ceiling with various features. There are circular openings, possibly for lighting or ventilation. The ceiling appears to have a pattern that could be textured acoustic tiles or similar materials designed to reduce noise levels. A series of circular lights is evenly spaced along the edge where the ceiling meets the walls. The image has been rotated 90 degrees clockwise, which results in an upside-down perspective as if looking at the underside of a typical ceiling from above. There are no people or other objects visible in this view. The background is blurred but suggests it could be the interior of a building with a high ceiling and some structural elements partially visible around the edges. "
