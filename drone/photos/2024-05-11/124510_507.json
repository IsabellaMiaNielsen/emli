    "Text": " This image shows an interior space with a high ceiling that has exposed ductwork or panels. The ceiling features a pattern of white and dark rectangles, possibly tiles or acoustic foam panels, which give the appearance of a textured ceiling. There are also circular objects on the ceiling, which could be light fixtures or ventilation elements. The floor appears to be tiled as well, and there is a wall with what looks like an opening or doorway. The image has been edited to have a split effect, showing two different perspectives: one side of the room (left) and another side (right). "
