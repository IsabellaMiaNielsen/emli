    "Text": " This image shows an interior view of a ceiling. The ceiling appears to have a grid-like design with white tiles, and there are several circular objects that could be light fixtures or sprinklers. There is a white object, possibly a fire sprinkler, in the center of the grid. In the lower right corner, there's a small section of wall with what looks like a fire extinguisher mounted on it. The image has a flat perspective and seems to be taken from below, looking up at the ceiling. There are no people or other significant details visible in this shot. "
