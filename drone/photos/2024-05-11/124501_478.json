    "Text": " The image shows a ceiling with a series of circular openings. Through these holes, you can see the underside of what appears to be a white structure or object, possibly part of an interior architecture design. The ceiling itself is textured and seems to have a patterned appearance. There are no visible people or items in the image, giving it a minimalist or abstract quality. The lighting is artificial, casting shadows on the ceiling below the openings. "
