    "Text": " This image shows a view from the ceiling of an interior space, likely a room in a building. The perspective is looking down at what appears to be a tile or paneled floor and a ceiling with circular tiles that could be acoustic panels or decorative elements. There are also three small items visible: two round objects on the left side and one larger circular object on the right. These objects might be light fixtures, fire sprinklers, or other ceiling-mounted equipment. The space looks clean and well-maintained, with a uniform design across the tiles. "
