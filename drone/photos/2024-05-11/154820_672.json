    "Text": " The image shows a ceiling with a pattern of black tiles. There are three circular objects that appear to be lighting fixtures, each positioned at the intersection of two ceiling grid lines. The ceiling has a textured appearance and is likely made of a material that can withstand high levels of foot traffic, such as concrete or resin. The background of the image is indistinct, but there seems to be a large open space that could be part of a public building like a train station or an airport terminal, given the scale and design of the ceiling structure.
