    "Text": " In the image, there is a person taking a selfie with a smartphone. The individual appears to be standing in an indoor space, as indicated by the ceiling tiles and what looks like air conditioning ducts visible behind them. They are wearing a maroon-colored hat and a long-sleeve shirt with a dark top and lighter bottom. The person is also holding a small object that could be a bag or case in their other hand. There's no text visible in the image. "
