However, I can tell you that there are multiple ceiling tiles visible in the photo, suggesting that this is likely an interior space with a tiled ceiling. There appear to be some round objects on the ceiling, which might be lights or smoke detectors. The image seems to have been taken from below, given the perspective of looking up towards the ceiling.
